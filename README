osso-applet-cplanguageregional
==============================

Control panel applet (and supporting binaries) to change system language and
regional settings.

Description
===========

Control panel applet can be used to change the system language and region, and
will restart the systme afterwards.

* `libcplanguageregional` is the control panel applet that allows the user to
  change languages
* `setlocale` is the binary that changes the system locale file
  (`/etc/osso-af-init/locale`)


Limitations
===========

Will only operate on locales that are currently available on the system, find
out which ones like this:

    localedef --list-archive

Fremantle allows setting many more regional settings, but we currently only
allow regional settings for available locales.
